		<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I lived in one of Courtyard007’s apartments for less than three months and decided to leave after two floods and a gas leakage. </span></p>
<h3>1st Flooding</h3>
<p><b></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">After three days in the countryside, I came back to Beijing to find my apartment completely flooded. The floor was still wet, a few bumps had formed and the carpet, shoes and anything touching the ground were completely soaked. I saw the agent in the courtyard (she lives there as well), informed her about the damages and asked her to send someone to have a look. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She replied that she did not know what was wrong and that I just had to deal with it, because the rain had been exceptionally heavy. When I insisted she </span><strong>deal </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">with the problem, </span><strong>the agent </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">switched topics and told me that calling her “Ayi” was highly offensive as I was older than her. I apologized and explained that it was a genuine language mistake. </span><strong>But </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">she kept the accusations coming. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She then told me I had to inform her every time I left Beijing for more than one day. She concluded by saying that she was going home otherwise she would beat me up and that I should never disturb her on her days off.  No worker showed up to look at the apartment.</span></p>

<p><strong>In July, on one of the days when heavy rain soaked Beijing</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, I asked the agent to keep an eye on my apartment while I was at work. When I sent a message to ask about the apartment, she replied that everything was fine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, when I came home I realized that my apartment flooded once again and that someone had been inside and moved a couple of objects to avoid them getting wet. The agent then told me that since it didn’t flood much, she felt no need to tell me. The amount of water </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">sprang up from the floor when pressing on the wooden planks made it obvious</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> that the apartment had a major structural issue</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The water seemed to come from underneath the floor, probably due to a complete lack of insulation. If within a week, a few wooden objects and some food turned moldy, one could only imagine the impact that this would have on </span><strong>a resident’s</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> health</strong>. <strong>Again</strong> the agent </span><strong>refused </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">to send someone or acknowledge this was a major issue. When</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I <strong>threatened to leave</strong></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if she took no action, she told me that I had no right to move</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> out over what she viewed as a small problem</strong>. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_72" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://dontrentcourtyard007.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screenshot-2016-09-22-21.48.58.png"><img class="size-large wp-image-72" src="https://dontrentcourtyard007.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screenshot-2016-09-22-21.48.58-1024x339.png" alt="Wet floor, moldy and wet walls and mold on wooden table" width="660" height="218" srcset="https://dontrentcourtyard007.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screenshot-2016-09-22-21.48.58-1024x339.png 1024w, https://dontrentcourtyard007.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screenshot-2016-09-22-21.48.58-300x99.png 300w, https://dontrentcourtyard007.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screenshot-2016-09-22-21.48.58-768x254.png 768w, https://dontrentcourtyard007.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screenshot-2016-09-22-21.48.58.png 1220w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px"></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Wet floor, moldy and wet walls and mold on wooden table</figcaption></figure><h3>Gas Leakage</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Living in a hutong and having to use a gas bottle I decided to buy a gas detector. When the alarm went off one night I asked the agent to come and do a proper check the next day. Instead of calling on a qualified technician, the agent just called the man selling gas bottles, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">who </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">did a dubious test with soap and water. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I told the guy to take away the gas bottle, as the test failed to meet </span><strong>any reasonable safety standard</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the agent did not intervene, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nor did she suggest </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">other alternatives, and just asked for her 100RMB of deposit back.</span></p>
<h3>Construction Work</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After one month living in the flat, the agent started expanding her house. As a result the courtyard shrank by a few meters, causing all the bicycles to be parked </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">directly </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in front of my entrance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Workers showed up on weekends, and when I told the agent that this was illegal, she pretended not to know and said that the renovations would be over in 5 days. After two months of ongoing construction work, the courtyard was regularly filled with dust and rubbish.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_73" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://dontrentcourtyard007.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screenshot-2016-09-22-21.53.18.png"><img class="size-large wp-image-73" src="https://dontrentcourtyard007.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screenshot-2016-09-22-21.53.18-1024x455.png" alt="Rubbish outside and inside the courtyard due to construction work" width="660" height="293" srcset="https://dontrentcourtyard007.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screenshot-2016-09-22-21.53.18-1024x455.png 1024w, https://dontrentcourtyard007.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screenshot-2016-09-22-21.53.18-300x133.png 300w, https://dontrentcourtyard007.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screenshot-2016-09-22-21.53.18-768x341.png 768w, https://dontrentcourtyard007.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screenshot-2016-09-22-21.53.18.png 1216w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px"></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Rubbish outside and inside the courtyard due to construction work</figcaption></figure><h3>Other Issues</h3>
<ul><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The agent instructed me not to talk to any neighbors and never to reveal how much rent was.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The agent never gave me my internet details. She charged me the full monthly fee of 120RMB, but she was most likely sharing the internet among a few households, considering how poor the speed was.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The agent told me never to contact her directly and to just write in a group chat with a cleaning lady and a few handymen. When I mentioned that they did not reply to many of my questions, she reiterated that I could not write to her directly.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The contract was very dodgy and only later did I realize that she had failed to include the photocopy of the landlord’s ID as well as of the property.</span></li>
