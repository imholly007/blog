		<description><![CDATA[Rented with holly for 6 months after living in Beijing for 2 years previously. She was great at first when the house leaked someone came round straight away. But after the 3rd time she started getting frustrated. At us for &quot;complaining to much&quot; rather than the shoddy workers that came to fix the roof but left 12 empty beer bottles and  a (still) leaking roof. I had to fight to get my deposit back and turned up at her office(s) 3 days in a row.

On top all the problems with the house (more than just leaks) she lies to the police. When giving your contract to the police she gives the price that she rents it at. Not the ridiculous prices she gives to foreigners this way she doesn&#039;t pay anything on the profit she makes. She is a thief and crook and I honestly don&#039;t know how she&#039;s not in prison. If someone sets up a sponsorship page to raise money to take her to court I will happily send money over.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I recently got absolutely robbed of my deposit and received a fraction of what I was meant to. In addition to the &#039;freezing&#039; the butt off post; my place was frozen for 3 days (no shower) and Holly was utterly useless all the while. Think I&#039;ll write a post of all the calamities throughout my year with her and send it to you. Don&#039;t want people going through what we did.]]></description>
